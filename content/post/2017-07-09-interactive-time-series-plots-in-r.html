<h2>Plotting Time Series Object</h2>
<p>There are lots of good plotting packages in R. And in this post I would like to show some of the interactive charting libraries to plot time series in R. If the object that you are trying to plot is a time-series object then one can plot it really easily.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lungDeaths &lt;- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths)
str(lungDeaths)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  Time-Series [1:72, 1:2] from 1974 to 1980: 2134 1863 1877 1877 1492 ...
##  - attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2
##   ..$ : NULL

<h2>Plotting data frame</h2>
<p>Most of the time your data don’t come nicely wrapped as a time series object often in R they come as data frame. Lets plot some data frame</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create sequence of dates 
dates &lt;- seq(ymd(&#39;2012-04-07&#39;),ymd(&#39;2012-04-07&#39;)+143,by=&#39;days&#39;)

<pre><code>## Warning in mutate_impl(.data, dots): &#39;.Random.seed&#39; is not an integer
## vector but of type &#39;NULL&#39;, so ignored</code></pre>

<h3>Plotting with dygraph</h3>
<p>In order to use dygraph we need to convert it into time series object here we are using <strong>ts</strong> package</p>

<p>If you do not want to convert data into time series in highchart there is still another way. First we have to convert or wide data frame to long dataframe using **reshape2&quot; pcakage. If you are unfamiliar with this cocenpt of wide and long format see <a href="http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Converting_data_between_wide_and_long_format/">here</a> for more.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I like plotting with highchart as I like the way its looks and with hihgchart there it is easy to plot all kind of interactive plots; however it comes with some cost if you are using for a business (although I would say it is worth paying for). I like dygraphs too it can be customized and it easy to plot if the plotting object is time series and it also offer high ineracitve properties. Plotly is good too with plenty of documentation and you can also easily share your charts. Another interactive plotting library that I didn’t show here was <strong>rCharts</strong> it is quite promising and frustrating at the same time as it does not go down well with the mark-down files. See here for what can you do with <a href="http://www.rpubs.com/dnchari/rcharts">rCharts</a></p>
